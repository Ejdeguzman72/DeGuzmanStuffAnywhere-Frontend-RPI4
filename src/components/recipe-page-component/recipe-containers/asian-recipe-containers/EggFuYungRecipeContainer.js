                <li>5 eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>3/4 cup vegetable stock</li>
                <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok over high heat. Add the shallots, bell pepper, celery, and garlic and stir‐fry for 3 minutes. Add the bean sprouts, stir‐fry for 1 minute, then add the shrimp and stir‐fry for 1 minute, or until the shrimp turn pink. Transfer to a bowl and let cool.</li>
                <li>Add the beaten eggs, stirring until well combined. Wash the wok and wipe dry with paper towels</li>
                <li>Return the wok to high heat and pour in 2in ﴾5cm﴿ oil.When the oil is hot, ladle 1/4 of the mixture into the oil. Fry about 2 minutes, until the underside is lightly browned, spooning a little of the hot oil over the eggs so the top starts to set.</li>
                <li>Carefully turn the egg cake over and cook 1 minute, until lightly browned on the other side. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Keep warm in a 200°F ﴾95°C﴿ oven while making the remaining cakes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, mix the stock, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and rice wine in a saucepan. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 tbsp cold water, and stir into the stock mixture. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring constantly until thickened; simmer for 1 minute. Serve the cakes with the sauce and rice.</li>
