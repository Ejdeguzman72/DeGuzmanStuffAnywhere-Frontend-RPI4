            <h1>Directions</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Peel potatoes and add to pot. Cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool and mash with a fork or potato masher.</li>
                <li>Combine 1 cup mashed potato, flour and egg in a large bowl. Knead until dough forms a ball. Shape small portions of the dough into long "snakes". On a floured surface, cut snakes into half-inch pieces.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; drain and serve.</li>
                <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer mushrooms to a plate, season with salt. Repeat with remaining 2 Tbsp oil  and mushrooms and more salt</li>
                <br></br>
                <li>In the bowl of a food processor or blender add the spinach, garlic, pine nuts, cheese, salt and pepper and pulse until well combined, but not totally smooth. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil while pulsing. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Add some chicken breast strips in there</li>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
