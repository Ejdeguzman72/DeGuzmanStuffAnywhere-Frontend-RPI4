            <h3>Directions - Pie Crust</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small mixing bowl add the egg and ice water. Whisk until combined, then set the bowl aside.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a food processor, add the flour and salt. Pulse briefly to mix the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add in the butter pieces. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal.</li>
                <li>Add in the egg/ice-water mixture. Pulse until a lovely dough forms.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly-floured board.</li>
                <li>Roll out the quiche crust to fit the approximate measurements of your quiche pan. Lay the crust on top of the quiche pan and with your hands, lightly press it into place.</li>
                <li>Stick the quiche pan with the dough into the freezer for approximately 20-25 minutes </li>
                <li>Roll it out, then fit into your 9-inch pie dish. Crimp or flute the edges.</li>
                <li>Chill the shaped pie crust for at least 30 minutes. This prevents shrinking. Remember that pie dough must be cold.</li>
                <li>Fill with pie weights</li>
                <li>Bake until the edges are lightly brown, about 15 minutes. Remove pie weights</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Directions - Filling</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small mixing bowl add the egg and ice water. Whisk until combined, then set the bowl aside.</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a food processor, add the flour and salt. Pulse briefly to mix the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add in the butter pieces. Pulse until the mixture resembles coarse meal.</li>
                <li>Add in the egg/ice-water mixture. Pulse until a lovely dough forms.</li>
                <li>Place sliced mushrooms in a skillet coated with 1 teaspoon olive oil or nonstick spray, add the garlic, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Turn the heat on to medium-high and sauté the mushrooms until they release all of their moisture and no more water remains on the bottom of the skillet, about 6-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk the eggs, milk, and parmesan cheese together until combined. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Bake the quiche until the center is just about set, about 50-60 minutes. Don’t over-bake. Use a pie crust shield to prevent the pie crust edges from over-browning. Cool for 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Or you can cool the quiche completely before serving– it’s fantastic at room temperature!</li>
            </ol>
